There are two regular tracks, both with white outside lines and a yellow dashed center line, designed to model lanes on real roads. One is for racing, the other for training

    黄色の中央線
    レース用と学習用

We will also a smaller structured-walls track (six-inch high rubber strips on inside and outside of track) for cars with Lidar or some other ranging sensor

Rules:

• 1.5 meter (5 foot) wide course with borders in[masked]mm (3-4 inch) wide white tape.

    １．５メータ  幅 １０ｃｍの白テープ

• yellow tape at the centerline 35mm – 55mm (1.5-2 inch) wide

    幅 3.5－5.5 cm黄色のライン

• The course must have at least one left turn, right turn, hairpin turn(1.5m outside radius) and gradual turn ( >3m outside radius)

右と左のターン
１．５ｍ半径のヘアピン
半径 ３ｍ以上の緩やかなカーブ

• Course should fit in a box 20m x 15m Up to 3 cars at a time (for now)

２０ x １５ｍ のコースで 一度に３台

• Course may not be smooth so the car should be able to handle step shaped bumps of up to 25mm (1 inch)

最大 2.5 cmの段差

• People will stand 2 meters away from the track.

コースから 2.5m 離れること

• The primary race is a time trial, where a single racer is timed for a single lap and three consecutive laps.

１周のラップ と ３週のラップ

• Races are clockwise, and although cars can go outside the white lines, they must pass all the checkpoint cones.

時計回り、外に飛び出してもよいが、チェックポイントのコーンは通過する必要あり。

• Racers are given three attempts to get their best time, which can be used in a single heat or spread out over several heats.

３回走行できる。予選１回、または 複数予選で使われる。ヒートレース（Heat Race）とは競馬において、同一の組み合わせの競走馬によって複数回の競走を行うことによって優勝馬を決定する方式の競走

• After the time trials, there is also a wheel-to-wheel race between any cars that would like to participate. Typically only two cars at the track at the same time, but exceptions can be made for smaller cars.

２台による １対１のレースも タイムトライアルの後に実施

-----------------------------

Other stuff that will be provided: Tables, chairs, power, wifi, coffee, pizza. And interesting fun.

Don't worry if you don't have anything to bring/hack on. You're welcome to just hang out and do the meetup thing. Or help others hack their things. This is that brief moment where we can all be n00bs. Someday our cars are supposed to be perfectly safe and autonomous. But for now, let's hack and crash while we still can.

Looking forward to seeing you all there!
